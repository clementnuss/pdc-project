#### OpenCV Python tutorials

[around here](http://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)

#### Dependencies setup

Using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/), and Open CV.
To install OpenCV with Python 3, follow the instructions on [this link](https://www.solarianprogrammer.com/2016/09/17/install-opencv-3-with-python-3-on-windows/)
Basically, you need to install [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587), and then to download and install compiled versions of numpy and opencv libraries for python, [on this webpage](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).
